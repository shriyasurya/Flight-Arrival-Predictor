The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model that can determine the arrival status of flights
into the Syracuse Hancock International Airport (SYR) in New York. Specifically, we are interested in
predicting whether each flight will be early, on-time, delayed, or severely delayed up to four days in
advance. To accomplish this,I utilised historical flight data, including scheduled and actual
arrival times, and weather conditions at the time of arrival. The resulting model will be valuable for
both airlines and travellers in managing schedules and making informed decisions about travel plans.

Libraries-
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- weatherbit API

Machine Learning Classifiers used-

- Gradient Boosting Classifier 
- Random Forest Classifier 
- Logistic Regression 
- Decision Tree Classifier 
- XGBoost Classifier

Historical flight and weather data was used to build a prediction model based on various machine learning algorithms as listed above. Also performed feature engineering and one-hot encoding to handle categorical and other variables from the dataset. The model was evaluated based on its accuracy score and its ability to predict flight arrival times on an unseen dataset.Overall, this project provides valuable insights into the potential applications of machine learning algorithms in the aviation industry. By accurately predicting flight arrival times, airlines and airports can improve their operational efficiency and provide better service to their customers.
